    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Potatoes au gratin is a creamy, cheesy dish made with thinly sliced potatoes layered with a mixture of grated Gruy√®re and sharp cheddar cheese. The potatoes are baked until golden and bubbly. The cheese forms a crispy, flavorful crust on top, while the interior is soft and creamy..</p>
    <ul>Ingredients
        <li>4 or 5 russet potatoes</li>
        <li>1 sweet onion</li>
        <li>8 ounces of White Extra Sharp Cheddar</li>
        <li>8 ounces of gruyere</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>Steps
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 F</li>
        <li>Grate, or thinly slice the two cheeses</li>
        <li>Using a mandolin (or thinly slicing with a knife), cut the onions and potatoes. <em>The potatoes should be sliced last once everything is ready, as after slicing they will quickly brown.</em></li>
        <li>In a greased 9x13 Pyrex, layer potatoes, onions, salt then cheese until all ingredients or space is used. Top with one final layer of cheese.</li>        
    </ol>
